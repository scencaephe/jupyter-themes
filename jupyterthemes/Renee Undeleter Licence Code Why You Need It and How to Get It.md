## Step 2: Choose a recovery mode and scan your device
 
Renee Undeleter offers four recovery modes for different scenarios:
 
- Fast Partition Scan: This mode can quickly scan the partition where you deleted your files and recover them from the recycle bin or other temporary folders. It is suitable for recovering files that were deleted recently or by mistake.
- Whole Partition Scan: This mode can deeply scan the entire partition and recover files that were deleted long time ago or by formatting. It can also recover files from corrupted or inaccessible partitions.
- Whole Disk Scan: This mode can scan the whole disk and find all the partition information and simulate the partition table. Then it can scan each partition carefully and recover files from them. It is suitable for recovering files from a disk that has been repartitioned or damaged.
- Image Creation: This mode can create a clone image of a partition or disk that can be used for backup or recovery purposes. It is suitable for recovering files from a device that is slow to read or has bad sectors.

To start the recovery process, launch Renee Undeleter and choose a recovery mode according to your situation. Then select the device or partition that you want to scan and click "Next". The software will start scanning your device and display the found files in a tree structure.
 
## Step 3: Preview and recover your files
 
After the scan is completed, you can preview the found files by clicking on them. You can also filter the files by type, size, date, or name to find your desired files more easily. To recover your files, just select them and click "Recover". You will be asked to choose a destination folder to save your recovered files. Make sure you do not save them to the same device or partition where you lost them to avoid overwriting.
 
That's it! You have successfully recovered your deleted files with Renee Undeleter. You can now open your recovered files and check if they are intact.
 
### Tips:

- To improve the chances of successful recovery, stop using your device or partition as soon as you realize that you have deleted some important files. Any further operation may overwrite the deleted files and make them unrecoverable.
