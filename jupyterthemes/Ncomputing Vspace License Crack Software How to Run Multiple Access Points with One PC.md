# How to Crack Ncomputing Vspace License Software
 
Ncomputing Vspace is a software that allows multiple users to share one computer by using access devices such as thin clients or laptops. It is a cost-effective and energy-efficient solution for schools, businesses, and organizations that need to provide computing access to many users with limited resources. However, Ncomputing Vspace requires a license to operate, and each license has a limited number of seats that can be used by access devices. If you want to crack Ncomputing Vspace license software and use it without paying for it, you will need to follow these steps:
 
1. Download and install Ncomputing Vspace software from the official website[^1^]. You will need to create an account and sign in to access the software downloads.
2. Open the Ncomputing Vspace Manager and click on Offline Registration. This will generate a registration file (vSpaceRegistration.oof) that you will need to download and save on a USB drive or another device[^2^].
3. Go to a computer that has an internet connection and visit the Ncomputing Management Portal[^2^]. Log in with your account and click on your name in the upper right corner. Then click on Offline Licensing and follow the instructions to upload the registration file (vSpaceRegistration.oof) that you downloaded in step 2.
4. After uploading the registration file, you will see a license file (licenseServerData.lic) that contains confirmed registration information and license allocation. Download this file and save it on the same USB drive or device that you used in step 2.
5. Go back to the computer where you installed Ncomputing Vspace software and copy the license file (licenseServerData.lic) to the folder where Ncomputing Vspace is installed (usually C:\Program Files\NComputing\vSpace Server). This will overwrite the existing license file and activate your Ncomputing Vspace software with unlimited seats.
6. Restart your computer and enjoy using Ncomputing Vspace software without any license restrictions.
