Attention: If you have a macOS computer with an ARM-based M1 chip, you may experience very poor performance when running MEGA. This is because MEGA is not designed or optimized to work on this type of processor. However, you can still use MEGA on your macOS system by installing and running the Windows or Linux version of MEGA through virtualization or emulation software. This software allows you to run a different operating system on your macOS computer. Some examples of virtualization or emulation software that you can use are Parallels, Crossover, and VMWareFusion.
